***About Me:***
Hello Everyone. My name is Matthew. I am a first year MURP student and I am excited to learn alongside you all. I am originally from San Diego, where I spent my entire childhood. I went to undergrad in Santa Cruz, and spent the last two years in Sacramento. My educational background is in Environmental Studies and I hope to one day be a part of the environmental planning field. In my free time I enjoy skateboarding and playing piano. Before enrolling at UCLA, I spent a year learning GIS at a community college where I was able to gain proficiency in ESRI products as well as take a few python based programming courses. However, I was never given the opportunity to use python in conjuction with GIS, so I am very excited about the content of this course. 
___
***Course Description:***
UP221 is a graduate level course in the Urban Planning department that teaches the foundations of Geographic Information Systems and Urban Data Science through the use Jupyter Notebooks and Python.
___
***Project Interests:***
I am a part of the Environmental Analysis and Policy concentration and am particularly interested in making maps that reflect environmental impacts. I think that it would be interesting to examine erosion along the California coastline that has been intensifying as a result of climate change. I believe this issue has a strong spatial component to it, making it suitable for mapping. I am also interested in water supply management and making maps that identify groundwater basins, watersheds, water use concentrations, etc. The impacts of climate change are numerous and maps provide an effective way to communicate these impacts, so I am open to working on any project in this area.
___
***Objectives:***
As I mentioned above, my background in GIS is limited to ESRI (as well as QGIS). I am hoping that this class provides a way of approaching spatial data in a more independent format. I also hope to refine my python skills which have declined, as I do not code in my daily life. Most of all, I really just want to make cool stuff and be learn new skills!
